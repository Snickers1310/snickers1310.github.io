            <p>NFTs are cryptographic tokens  – much like a cryptocurrency – that are recorded on a blockchain and can be used to prove the authenticity, ownership and provenance of anything – physical or non-physical – such as artwork, collectable cards, or real estate, for example, in much the same way as a blockchain can be used to settle financial transactions or track elements in a supply chain. “Non-fungible” implies the token is unique and cannot be duplicated or swapped for anything else (unlike individual bitcoins, for example, which are “fungible”). </p>
            <p>NFTs are not just for tokenising assets. They can also act as smart contracts – contracts that are programmed to automatically execute certain actions in certain conditions. So in the case of “Everydays”, for example, the NFT gives the originator of the token a cut of future sales, with Beeple receiving 10%. This can help artists to secure a reliable source of income – and more importantly perhaps, a chunk of future resale value. </p>
            <p>
                NFTs are not entirely new. The first type of NFTs to hit the market were “Coloured Coins” in 2012, which are bitcoin tokens with extra functionality that allowed them to represent other assets on the blockchain.  In 2017 (notably, another boom/bubble period for crypto generally), NFTs and digital art came together to create “Cryptokitties” – digitally-created cartoon cats that can be bought and sold with NFTs verifying ownership. Crypokitties were created "to explore the concept of digital scarcity, implement a non-fungible token within smart contracts”, says their creator.
                But a renewed interest in cryptocurrencies and a boom in digital art have thrust NFTs into mainstream consciousness. It’s not just obscure digital artists getting in on the act – earlier this year visual artist and musical performer Grimes, better known today perhaps as Elon Musk’s ex-partner, made $6m in minutes, by selling digital art backed by NFTs.
                Jack Dorsey, co-founder and – until recently – chief executive of Twitter, also got involved by auctioning off the first tweet ever to appear on the social media website. The tweet – from Dorsey’s account – simply said "just setting up my twitter”. It sold for $2.9m.
                The winner of the auction received a “digital certificate” of Dorsey’s first ever tweet. What does that actually mean? The tweet remains publicly available on the platform under Dorsey’s account. And the “owner” – as certified by the NFT – won’t be able to delete it or do anything with it. They will merely have been recorded as being the owner.
                It is perhaps this which has left many people scratching their head – vast amounts of money are exchanging hands with no apparent benefit apart from the knowledge that you are the owner of an original, one which may have spawned millions of entirely identical copies. Some proponents compare it to owning the Mona Lisa versus owning a student poster of said masterpiece, but unsurprisingly, that’s not an argument to convince the sceptics.

            <li>Purchase a small amount of Ethereum</li>
            <li>Connect your wallet to an NFT Marketplace</li>

                <li>If you haven't already done so, you'll need to determine what unique digital asset you want to turn into an NFT. It can be a custom painting, picture, music, video game collectible, meme, GIF, or even a tweet. An NFT is a unique digital item with a sole owner. That rarity gives an NFT value. Make sure that you own the intellectual property rights to the item you want to turn into an NFT. Creating an NFT for a digital asset you don't own could get you into legal trouble. </li>

                <li>Once you've selected your unique digital asset, it's time to start the process of minting it into an NFT. That begins by determining the blockchain technology you intend to use for your NFT. The most popular among NFT artists and creators is Ethereum. Other popular options include Tezos, Polkadot, Cosmos, and Binance Smart Chain.</li>
                <li>
                    If you don't already have a digital wallet, you'll want to set one up to create your NFT since you'll need some cryptocurrency to fund your initial investment. The wallet will provide you with access to your digital assets. The top NFT wallets include Metamask, Math Wallet, AlphaWallet, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet.

                    Once you set up your digital wallet, you'll want to buy some cryptocurrency. Most NFT platforms accept Ether, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain platform. If you already own some cryptocurrency elsewhere, you'll want to connect it to your digital wallet so you can use it to create and sell NFTs.
